                <h1>What is Biohack?</h1>
                <h2>Accelerating Design and Innovation</h2>
                <p>A hackathon is an multi-day event where students practice and develop their computer programming skills to create ideas and projects. This year, a collaboration with the Society of Women Engineers and Biomedical Engineering Society introduces BioHack, the very first student-run 12 hour bioengineering-themed hackathon at the University of California, Riverside. Throughout this 12-hour hackathon, students will form teams to work on projects, attend technical workshops, speak to mentors, learn about new technologies, and network with industries.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to foster connections among students and sponsors throughout computer science and bioengineering. We encourage non-computer science or engineering students, especially females* and minorities, to develop valuable technical and teamwork skills in a safe and encouraging environment. Also, hosting BioHack in the Inland Empire will spawn connections with engineers throughout the bioengineering community across California.  UCR students who are curious are welcome to join; no experience necessary!</p>
